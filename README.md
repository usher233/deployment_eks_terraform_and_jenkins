## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to leverage Jenkins for continuous detection and automatic updating of an Amazon EKS cluster in response to changes made to a GitHub repository. The setup facilitates an automated CI/CD pipeline that triggers updates at regular intervals. The repository is structured into two main parts:

- `jenkinsServer`: Contains the necessary Terraform code to set up a Jenkins server on an AWS EC2 instance.
- `EKS`: Includes the Terraform code for setting up Amazon EKS, the Jenkins pipeline configuration files, and sample Kubernetes manifests for deployment.

Feel free to explore the folders to understand the setup and configurations.

Happy Building!
